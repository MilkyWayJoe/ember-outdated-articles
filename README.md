# Help! I need somebody...
Whoa, many bits have been spilled about Ember. But the Ember of today is hardly Ember of yesteryear.  I'm compiling a list of outdated Ember articles (there's a funny venn-diagram joke in there) so I can contact their authors and ask them to include a notice.

Something like:

> *Hey!* This article references a pre-release version of Ember. Now that Ember has reached 1.0 the code samples below are no longer
correct and the expressed opinions _may_ no longer be accurate.
